##Troubleshooting

###Background processing
There is a [known issue](http://esriosmeditor.codeplex.com/workitem/11131) with running several of the OpenStreetMap Editor for ArcGIS tools when background processing is enabled in ArcMap. The result will be ArcMap crashing or the tool not completing successfully, often with an 'invalid tool' error. To disable background processing, follow instructions in the [Foreground and background processing ArcGIS 10.1](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//00210000003q000000) help topic.
