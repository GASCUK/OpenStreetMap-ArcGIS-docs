##Layers

The zip file contains a series of template layer files at a range of zoom levels with symbology based on the OSM Humanitarian CartoCSS style.

The layers are designed to be used with data loaded using the ArcGIS OpenStreetMap Editor tools.

It is recommended to build an attribute index for the specific tags used in each feature class.

Additional to raw OSM data, bathymetry and land data is also required to use these layers. Please see the 
[here](data.md) for more information and to download the required files.
